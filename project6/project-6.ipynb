For example, adding more spaces to the file that does not change the meaning of the file but should generate different hash. Test your luck if you can find a hash collision. \n","\n","b.\tIn general, with hash256, it is rarely luck to find a collision. Change the hash to a weak one, say MD4. I guess unless you are using specific technique like herding, you will not be able to find collision either. Again, if you are luck, you can.\n","\n","c.\tThen you shall move to hash puzzle. It is basically finding certain hash that satisfy set conditions. For example, the first 8 bits are zero. For our project, you start from 1 bit zero and gradually move to 8 bit zeros. You can stop anytime. \n","\n","d.\tSummarize what you have found.\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
