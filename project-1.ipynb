    "# Problem1: Affine Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "> Affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher that uses modular arithmetic to encrypt the letters of a message. The mathematical module formula is c = ap + b mod n where input p is plaintext, the output c is the ciphertext, n is a modular integer, a and b are non-negative integers less than n, a and n are relatively prime (to do decryption). We assume all the letters are encoded to unique integers."

    "> Describe affine cipher in more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "For the affine cipher, each letter of an alphabet maps to an integer. The mathematical formula c = ap + b mod n is then applied to each letter individually to produce the ciphertext letter. This process repeats for every letter in the plaintext until the message is complete. For example, A is 0, B is 1, C is 2…, and Z is 25, where mod n=26. The cipher key is represented by a and b, where a must be selected in a way that a and m have no common factors other than 1 (coprime) so that there is a modular multiplicative inverse to decrypt the ciphertext letter successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption example:\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt the letter “S” using the formula c = ap + b mod n and encryption key of (3,7), we would follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the integer equivalent of the plaintext letter: The integer value of the letter S is 18. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a = 3, b = 7, and n = 26. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, apply the formula, and we get 3 x 18 + 7 = 61. \n",
    "\n",
    "61 mod 26 = 9 (when you divide 61 by 26, you get 2 and a remainder of 9.)\n",
    "\n",
    "9 is the integer equivalent of the letter J. \n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt the message, the opposite or inverse operation is performed. The formula for decryption is p = a^-1 ( c - b ) mod n. where a^-1 is the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo n. For instance, if a*x = 1 (mod 26), then x is an inverse of a, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt the letter J back to S (while knowing the encryption key, which is 3 and 7), we would do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for decryption is p = a^-1 ( c - b ) mod n.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that c = 9 (the integer equivalent of J) and b = 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a mod n, where (3 * a^-1) mod 26 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a number x mod 26 = 1. That would be 27. And 27 divided by 3 gives you 9. \n",
    "\n",
    "Check: (3*9) mod 26 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, plug the numbers in the decryption formula: p = 9 * (9 – 7) mod 26.\n",
    "\n",
    "p = 9 * 2 mod 26\n",
    "\n",
    "p = 18 mod 26 = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "The letter equivalent of 18 is S. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the affine cipher is a form of symmetric encryption where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, traditional methods are not feasible for decryption without knowing the cipher key. We can employ cryptoanalysis techniques such as frequency analysis, known plaintext attacks, brute force, etc., to decrypt the ciphertext when the cipher key is unknown. However, that can be very complex and time-consuming.\n"

Given a number n, the phi function Φ(n) outputs the number of integers that are less than or equal to n, and are relatively prime (or coprime) to n. For example, if we want to find Φ(8), we will count how many integers from 1 to 8 does not share a factor greater than 1, which will be 1, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, Φ(8) = 4. \n",
