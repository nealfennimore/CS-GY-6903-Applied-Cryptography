The algorithm is an improvement of the Vernam cipher where plain text is encrypted using its own key. There are a couple of requirements for the One-Time pad to ensure perfect secrecy. The first requirement is the use of a truly random generated key that is as long as the size of the plain text message. The second requirement is that the key used to encrypt/decrypt is used only once, and then discarded.\n","\n","In a One-Time pad, a number is assigned to each character of the plain text. The number of possible encryptions increases exponentially with a large message. For example, to encrypt ‘ALICE’ the number of possibilities is almost 12 million (26^5 --> 11,881,376). This can also be a problem because as the One-Time pad makes the large quantities of random keys, there is a need to handle the immense key distribution.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Problem 2 \n","\n","> Write a python programming code (or your favorite programing language) to realize the onetime Pad’s encryption and decryption algorithms.
